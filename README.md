# Spine-X-ray-images-Classification

Explored the classification of spine X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Scoliosis, and Spondylolisthesis. Leveraging the power of deep learning, utilized pretrained models—Xception, InceptionV3, and DenseNet—enhanced with an attention mechanism to improve classification accuracy.
